# README
Repo to share and store code for data collection, cleaning, and visualisation for the Scrapy Party group/


TODO: 
- Finalize the results we would like to present. (2006 event is great start, we need one more for late 2010s, or several potential explanations). Annotation scores.

- Decide which figures and plots we would like to include in the report. Improve and polish the graphs.

- Decide which methods we want to address (besides scraping). Time-series analysis? Cross examination of data with national/political events?

- Decide how we want to fit the annotation task into our project. That is, conjure some link between "interest score" and a broader research question. For example, (We wanted to examine if international articles sparked more interest as they combine international perspectives).

- Determine who is in charge of the following sections: (Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion)

	- Tonio (Introduction, Abstract, Related Work)

	- Mikas (Data, Scraping aspect of Methods)
	
	- Daria TBD

	- Markus (Time Series Analysis & Visualization)

	- Antonia TBD
